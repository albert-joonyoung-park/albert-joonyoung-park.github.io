        "**Understanding Dictionary Key Types**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, dictionaries are versatile data structures used for mapping keys to corresponding values. While dictionaries allow flexibility in storing values of any Python data type as their values, there are specific requirements and considerations when it comes to selecting suitable key types. This aspect of dictionary design is crucial to ensure efficient and reliable key-value pair lookups and operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Characteristics of Dictionary Keys**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Immutability Requirement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    The primary requirement for dictionary keys is that they should generally be **immutable objects**. Immutability refers to the property of an object that prevents its state from being modified after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Examples of Immutable Key Types:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Scalar Types:** Examples of immutable scalar types suitable as dictionary keys include integers (**`int`**), floating-point numbers (**`float`**), and strings (**`str`**). These types are inherently immutable, which means once you create a key with a specific value, that key-value pair remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Tuples as Composite Keys:** Tuples can also serve as dictionary keys, but there's an important condition: all the objects within the tuple must also be immutable. This ensures the stability of the key, as the tuple itself remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Significance of Hashability**\n",
        "\n",
        "The technical term that ties these requirements together is **\"hashability.\"** Hashability refers to an object's ability to be hashed, which involves converting the object into a fixed-size numerical value, known as a hash code. This hash code is used as an index to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs in a dictionary. The key feature of hashable objects is that they produce the same hash code consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Role of the `hash()` Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can determine whether an object is hashable and can be used as a dictionary key by utilizing the built-in **`hash()`** function. When you apply the **`hash()`** function to an object, it returns a hash code if the object is hashable. However, keep in mind that not all Python objects are hashable, particularly mutable objects like lists and dictionaries.\n"

Unlike lists or tuples, which allow duplicates, sets only store distinct values. This characteristic makes sets ideal for various tasks, such as removing duplicates from a list, checking for membership, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference. One of the most common real-world use cases for sets is in data deduplication, where they excel at efficiently eliminating duplicate records from datasets, ensuring data integrity and enhancing the performance of data processing tasks.\n"
