Throughout this case study, I undertook various real-world tasks as a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and meet different characters and team members, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse characters and team members. The project aimed to address key business questions by following the structured data analysis process, which included the steps of **asking** questions, **preparing** data, **processing** information, **analyzing** insights, **sharing** findings, and taking appropriate **actions**.\n\n# Scenario\n\nYou are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global **smart device** market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n\n## Characters and products\n\n-   **Characters**\n    -   **Urška Sršen:** Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n    -   **Sando Mur:** Mathematician and Bellabeat's cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n    -   **Bellabeat marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Bellabeat''s mission and business goals --- as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Bellabeat achieve them.\n-   **Products**\n    -   **Bellabeat app:** The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n\n    -   **Leaf:** Bellabeat's classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n\n    -   **Time:** This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n\n    -   **Spring:** This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n\n    -   **Bellabeat membership:** Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n## About the company\n\nUrška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n\nSršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n## Project deliverables\n\nProduce a report with the following deliverables:\n\n> 1.

Identify the business task**\n\n  The business objective is to convert occasional riders into annual members, which is crucial for driving   the company's future growth. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identify trends and differences   in riding behavior between casual riders and annual members. The insights derived from this analysis   will serve as a foundation for informing the company's marketing strategies and efforts aimed at   converting casual riders into loyal annual members.\n\n**2. Key stakeholders:**\n\n  Cyclistic executive team, Director of Marketing (Lily Moreno), Marketing Analytics team\n\n::: {.deliverable style=\"background-color: yellow;\"}\n**\\*\\* Statement of the business task \\*\\***\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to analyze the historical bike trip data of Cyclistic in order to identify and understand the differences between casual riders and annual members. By examining the data, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that distinguish the riding behaviors of these two user groups.\n:::\n\n# Prepare\n\n**Key tasks:**\n\n**1. Download data and store it appropriately.**\n\nThe previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data is available for download [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). They are made available by Motivate International Inc., under [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). 12 CSV files have been downloaded and saved in the folder C:\\\\Users\\\\Joon\\\\git\\\\albert-joonyoung-park.github.io\\\\data.\n\n**2. Identify how it's organized**\n\nThe data files are in csv format, and organized into individual month for the past 12 month period.\n\n**3. Sort and filter the data.**\n\nA spreadsheet was used to conduct an initial inspection of the data files, revealing several issues that require data cleaning and transformation.\n\n-   Many columns exhibit missing values, including: started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, and end_lat.\n\n-   The ride_id column contains inconsistent data types, with a mixture of character and numeric data.\n\n-   When calculating the 'ride length' based on the 'started_at' and 'ended_at' columns, some results indicate unrealistic durations, such as trips exceeding 24 hours or trips with durations of just a few minutes or zero.\n\n-   All files share identical column names and have the same number of columns.\n\n-   Each data file contains a substantial number of rows, ranging from 180,000 to 800,000+ rows.\n\n**4. Determine the credibility of the data.**\n\n**ROCCC** measurement was applied to check the credibility of the data.\n\n-   **R**eliable (R): The dataset provides a complete 12-month bike trip data, but it may have some limitations or biases.\n-   **O**riginal (O): The dataset is sourced directly from Cyclistic, the company in question, making it a first-party and publicly available dataset.\n-   **C**omprehensive (C): The dataset contains sufficient information to address the specific business task at hand.\n-   **C**urrent (C): The dataset is up-to-date, encompassing the full-year bike trip data for the current period.\n-   **C**ited (C): The dataset is publicly available and properly cited online, providing clear references and license information from both the company and the municipality.\n\n::: deliverable\n**\\*\\* A description of all data sources used \\*\\***\n\nThe analysis utilized 12 bike trip CSV data files obtained from Cyclistic, covering the period from May 1, 2022, to April 30, 2023. These data files were sourced as first-party public data from Motivate International Inc.

Create a marketing campaign that educates casual riders on their long-ride trips and invites them to a membership that can cater to their riding needs year-round. The campaign can be advertised both online and offline, with a focus on regions where the most popular stations for casual riders are located. This recommendation is supported by the data analysis, which highlights the long ride durations of casual riders and emphasizes the value of a membership that can provide continuous benefits.\n\n2.  Consider creating a specialty membership specifically designed for docked-bike users. This targeted approach can be an effective way to engage casual riders who prefer docked bikes. However, instead of offering a separate membership, it may be more beneficial to incorporate docked-bike usage as an additional feature within the existing full-scale membership. This way, casual riders can experience the benefits of membership without creating a distinct membership category.\n\n3.  Develop a special introductory membership for the months between April and September or for the days of the week (Friday to Sunday). This limited-time membership can serve as a trial period, offering casual riders the opportunity to experience the benefits of a membership during the most popular seasons or days. Following the introductory period, you can then transition these riders to a regular yearly membership.\n",
