I'm Albert Park, a freelance Data Analyst with a knack for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. My experience spans e-commerce, retail, manufacturing, and database application development, where I've helped businesses optimize operations and boost profitability.

I love working closely with people, digging into data, and uncovering the stories it tells. Whether it's fine-tuning pricing strategies or enhancing operational efficiency, my goal is to empower informed decisions.

Outside of work, I enjoy family time, exploring data science, singing in my church choir.
