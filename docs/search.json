    "text": "Characters and teams\n\nCyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\nLily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\nCyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\nCyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program."

    "section": "About the company",
    "text": "About the company\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends."

    "section": "Three recommendations",
    "text": "Three recommendations\n\nCreate a marketing campaign that educates casual riders on their long-ride trips and invites them to a membership that can cater to their riding needs year-round. The campaign can be advertised both online and offline, with a focus on regions where the most popular stations for casual riders are located. This recommendation is supported by the data analysis, which highlights the long ride durations of casual riders and emphasizes the value of a membership that can provide continuous benefits.\nConsider creating a specialty membership specifically designed for docked-bike users. This targeted approach can be an effective way to engage casual riders who prefer docked bikes. However, instead of offering a separate membership, it may be more beneficial to incorporate docked-bike usage as an additional feature within the existing full-scale membership. This way, casual riders can experience the benefits of membership without creating a distinct membership category.\nDevelop a special introductory membership for the months between April and September or for the days of the week (Friday to Sunday). This limited-time membership can serve as a trial period, offering casual riders the opportunity to experience the benefits of a membership during the most popular seasons or days. Following the introductory period, you can then transition these riders to a regular yearly membership."
