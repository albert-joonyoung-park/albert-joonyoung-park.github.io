<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document serves as the case study capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Throughout this case study, I undertook various real-world tasks as a junior data analyst. I was employed at Cyclistic, a fictional company, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse characters and team members. The project aimed to address key business questions by following the structured data analysis process, which included the steps of <strong>asking</strong> questions, <strong>preparing</strong> data, <strong>processing</strong> information, <strong>analyzing</strong> insights, <strong>sharing</strong> findings, and taking appropriate <strong>actions</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="scenario" class="level1">
<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago, dedicated to optimizing its future success by maximizing the number of annual memberships. As the director of marketing, you recognize the importance of understanding the distinct usage patterns between casual riders and annual members in order to develop an effective marketing strategy. The goal is to convert casual riders into loyal annual members, ultimately driving the company’s growth.</p>
<section id="characters-and-teams" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="characters-and-teams">Characters and teams</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cyclistic</strong>: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lily Moreno</strong>: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cyclistic marketing analytics team</strong>: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cyclistic executive team</strong>: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="about-the-company" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-company">About the company</h2>
<p>In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.</p>
<p>Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.</p>
<p>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.</p>
<p>Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.</p>

<p><strong>Key tasks:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Identify the business task</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The business objective is to convert occasional riders into annual members, which is crucial for driving &nbsp;&nbsp;the company’s future growth. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identify trends and differences &nbsp;&nbsp;in riding behavior between casual riders and annual members. The insights derived from this analysis &nbsp;&nbsp;will serve as a foundation for informing the company’s marketing strategies and efforts aimed at &nbsp;&nbsp;converting casual riders into loyal annual members.</p>

<p><strong>** Statement of the business task **</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to analyze the historical bike trip data of Cyclistic in order to identify and understand the differences between casual riders and annual members. By examining the data, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that distinguish the riding behaviors of these two user groups.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="prepare" class="level1">
<h1>Prepare</h1>
<p><strong>Key tasks:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Download data and store it appropriately.</strong></p>
<p>The previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data is available for download <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>. They are made available by Motivate International Inc., under <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license</a>. 12 CSV files have been downloaded and saved in the folder C:\Users\Joon\git\albert-joonyoung-park.github.io\data.</p>
<p><strong>2. Identify how it’s organized</strong></p>
<p>The data files are in csv format, and organized into individual month for the past 12 month period.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sort and filter the data.</strong></p>
<p>A spreadsheet was used to conduct an initial inspection of the data files, revealing several issues that require data cleaning and transformation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many columns exhibit missing values, including: started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, and end_lat.</p></li>
<li><p>The ride_id column contains inconsistent data types, with a mixture of character and numeric data.</p></li>
<li><p>When calculating the ‘ride length’ based on the ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ columns, some results indicate unrealistic durations, such as trips exceeding 24 hours or trips with durations of just a few minutes or zero.</p></li>
<li><p>All files share identical column names and have the same number of columns.</p></li>
<li><p>Each data file contains a substantial number of rows, ranging from 180,000 to 800,000+ rows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Determine the credibility of the data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ROCCC</strong> measurement was applied to check the credibility of the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R</strong>eliable (R): The dataset provides a complete 12-month bike trip data, but it may have some limitations or biases.</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>riginal (O): The dataset is sourced directly from Cyclistic, the company in question, making it a first-party and publicly available dataset.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>omprehensive (C): The dataset contains sufficient information to address the specific business task at hand.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>urrent (C): The dataset is up-to-date, encompassing the full-year bike trip data for the current period.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>ited (C): The dataset is publicly available and properly cited online, providing clear references and license information from both the company and the municipality.</li>
</ul>
<div class="deliverable">
<p><strong>** A description of all data sources used **</strong></p>
<p>The analysis utilized 12 bike trip CSV data files obtained from Cyclistic, covering the period from May 1, 2022, to April 30, 2023. These data files were sourced as first-party public data from Motivate International Inc.&nbsp;The original files used for analysis are named as follows:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-findings">Key findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The bikes were used by members more frequently than casual users, with a 24.12% higher usage rate in the last 12 months.</p></li>
<li><p>However, casual riders had longer ride duration compared to members, with an average difference of 4-7 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>From a quarterly perspective, the third and second quarters of the year were the most popular seasons for casual riders.</p></li>
<li><p>Casual riders exhibited a preference for riding bikes on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and they had longer trip duration during these days.</p></li>
<li><p>Among the rideable types, classic bikes were the most popular choice among casual riders.</p></li>
<li><p>Casual riders were the only user group that utilized docked bikes.</p></li>
<li><p>“Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave” and “DuSable Lake Shore Dr &amp; Monroe St” were the most common starting stations for casual users.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="three-recommendations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="three-recommendations">Three recommendations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a marketing campaign that educates casual riders on their long-ride trips and invites them to a membership that can cater to their riding needs year-round. The campaign can be advertised both online and offline, with a focus on regions where the most popular stations for casual riders are located. This recommendation is supported by the data analysis, which highlights the long ride durations of casual riders and emphasizes the value of a membership that can provide continuous benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider creating a specialty membership specifically designed for docked-bike users. This targeted approach can be an effective way to engage casual riders who prefer docked bikes. However, instead of offering a separate membership, it may be more beneficial to incorporate docked-bike usage as an additional feature within the existing full-scale membership. This way, casual riders can experience the benefits of membership without creating a distinct membership category.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a special introductory membership for the months between April and September or for the days of the week (Friday to Sunday). This limited-time membership can serve as a trial period, offering casual riders the opportunity to experience the benefits of a membership during the most popular seasons or days. Following the introductory period, you can then transition these riders to a regular yearly membership.</p></li>
